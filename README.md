# programming calculator operations
-Legal operators shall be *, /, +, - (multiply, divide, add, subtract)
-Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces
-Mixed numbers will be represented by whole_numerator/denominator. e.g. "3_1/4"

# development approach
1. OneLoginExercise.java: Calculator Code
2. OneLoginExerciseTest.java: Test cases for OneLoginExercise.java file
-Both files are in package com.onelogin.calculator but package definition can be removed while running locally.
-Use the Eclipse IDE for development purpose.
-Unit Test: By running it locally and passing the various params in "run Configuration" setting in Eclipse.

# assumptions
-Consider that value passed in argument and there operation result is not so long i.e. it can be hold in a Integer/Double. Please let me know if this is not the case.
